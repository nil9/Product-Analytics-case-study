# Product-Analytics-case-study

1. Choose 2 KPI's which you think are the most important for measuring the success of our
funnel.
For each:
a. Provide a summary of our bank's performance against this KPI across our different
user groups.
b. Given what you know about our bank and using your analysis in part (a), provide
some specific recommendations as to how we might improve this metric.
2. A Product Manager (PM) has approached you for advice on running an A/B test in the
sign-up step of the funnel (between sign_up_initiated and sign_up_completed ). They want
to test swapping the order of the first two steps in the sign-up form, but they don't have much
experience in running tests. Write-up a short experimental design which the PM can use as
the basis for the experiment. This should include your recommendations on:
a. the experimental setup and success criteria
b. the required sample size & how long the experiment should be run for
c. how to measure and interpret the results
d. any other considerations the PM should keep in mind
## Output
Please visualize all your findings / reasoning in an appropriate way.
Consolidate all your findings into a short (5-10min) PPT / Google Slides Presentation.
Imagine this will be aimed at the Product Leadership Team. You will present these slides
during your technical interview.
